# dictycontent-schema
Postgresql schema definition files to install and manage `dictycontent
database`. `dictycontent-database` is the backend for storing serialized json
content. The content is primarily generated from `javascript object` representation of a rich
text editor framework called [draft-js](https://draftjs.org/).
It is also a source repository for docker image to run
[goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose), the database migration tool.
